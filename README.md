# Simple Todo App

This is just a simple  To Do app to help with your daily task and routines.
## Functionality

Here is a pretty basic Way to track, add and remove To Do Task.

## Technology

HTML,CSS,JavaScript

Implemented OOP into my JavaScript to Encapsulate logic for different items, and added Events to manage and Add new ToDos,Delete ToDos ,Check/UnCheck in checkbox feature, and Form Validation features.

Data Handling
UUID Genertation so evey item/ToDo has its own Unique Id.

Added a Date Handling Feature to use and process Due Dates.
I used the toLocaleString(); for a user friendly display.
